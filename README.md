just stumbled out of the theater with my head swimming. rosario was... well, imagine if a fireworks display collided with a poetry reading & both were riding a rollercoaster at the same time. that's how intense & jarring it all felt. I swear, the theater smelled like burnt popcorn & someone's cheap cologne. my back is killing me from that seat, like i’ve been bench pressing a rhino.  

the opening scene — BAM. immediately pulled me in, like a vacuum yanking at a loose thread. one minute i’m sipping my soda, the next i’m somewhere in the depths of rosario’s world. like that one time i thought my sock was a rat, randomly enough? idk sudden and odd.

> and then there was that moment in the market... or was it a dream sequence? voices so lively you could feel the garlic dust on your fingertips but somehow the words just... slipped right around like soapy eels. i think i forgot to breathe for a portion of it. and the colors! more vibrant than a toddler’s crayon set taking a dip in the sun.

some guy behind me was munching on popcorn as if it was his last meal, crunch-crunch, just like thunder punctuating quiet scenes. god, i’m still brushing off crumbs as i remember that love scene – raw, yet tender, like an open wound with a soothing balm. there's no download the movie option like legally, but worth seeing. totally. 

that chase scene, tho. cars swerving like drunken eagles and a soundtrack that might as well have been a bass inside my ribcage. i'm not even sure who was chasing who by the end. my brain was spammed with images and adrenaline like that time i got lost in IKEA.

watch the movie. seriously, for whatever sanity’s sake, even if half of it sweeps past in this weird dreamy haze where you're never quite sure who’s actually alive or if it's all a metaphor for, i dunno, existential crisis involving cats. which reminds me, need to feed my cat...

and suddenly, the credits rolled like they’d tripped, stumbled, then collapsed — just before that last conversation. haunting yet whimsical. like... nun-chucks made of daffodils kind of whimsical? i don't know.
